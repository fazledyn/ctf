## Explanation
Notice that total_cost is declared as an int. This is specifically a Signed Integer, which has a range between -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Signed integers use the first bit to store whether it is negative or positive, 0 indicating positive and 1 indicating negative. What happens if you add 1 to 2,147,483,647 and store the result in a signed integer? Well the first bit goes from 0 to 1, meaning that the number is now negative! In fact, due to the way Two's Complement, the method used to represent negative numbers in binary, works, it actually wraps around to the most negative integer: -2,147,483,648.

This is what is known as an Integer Overflow. We can use this to overflow the total_cost variable and increase our account balance. We need a total_cost that is a large negative number, but not too large that it also overflows our account_balance. 3000000 works nicely as the number of fake flags to buy:
